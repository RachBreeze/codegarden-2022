##  Background

Created as part of the [CodeGarden 2022 Challenge](https://umbraco.com/blog/join-the-codegarden-challenge/)

As an additional goal I wanted to use kit that would be available at [CoderDojo](https://coderdojo.com/) so that it could be used or extended on at local CoderDojos. And use the MakerCode building blocks
